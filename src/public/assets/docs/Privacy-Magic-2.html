Definitions
The following definitions of terms used in this document are drawn from Article 4 of the European Union’s
General Data Protection Regulation:
Personal Data: Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("Data Subject") who
can be identified, directly or indirectly, from such data, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a
name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or one or more factors specific to the
physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of the Data Subject.
Sensitive Personal Data: Personal data which are, by their nature, particularly sensitive in relation to
fundamental rights and freedoms merit specific protection as the context of their processing could create
significant risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject. Those personal data include
personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade
union membership, genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data
concerning health or data concerning the data subject’s sex life or sexual orientation.
Data Controller: The natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body, which alone or
jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.
Data Processor: A natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body which processes
personal data on behalf of a Data Controller.
Processing: An operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal
data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage,
adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise
making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction of the data.
Anonymisation: Irreversibly de-identifying personal data such that the person cannot be identified by using
reasonable time, cost, and technology either by the controller or by any other person to identify that
individual. The personal data processing principles do not apply to anonymized data as it is no longer
personal data.
Pseudonymisation: The processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be
attributed to a specific Data Subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional
information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the
personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person. Pseudonymisation reduces, but
does not completely eliminate, the ability to link personal data to a data subject. Because pseudonymised
data is still personal data, the processing of pseudonymised data should comply with the Personal Data
Processing principles.
Supervisory Authority: An independent public authority which is established by a Member State pursuant to
Article 51 of the EU GDPR.
Basic Principles Regarding Personal Data Processing
The data protection principles outline the basic responsibilities for organisations handling personal data.
Article 5(2) of the GDPR stipulates that “the controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate,
compliance with the principles.”
4.1 Lawfulness, Fairness and Transparency
We will only process personal data where we have one of the following ‘lawful bases’ (legal reasons) to do
so under data protection law:
The data needs to be processed so that MAGIC MEDICAL can fulfil a contract with the individual , i.e. we
need the data in order to carry out your instructions , or the individual has asked MAGIC MEDICAL to take
specific steps before entering into a contract
The data needs to be processed so that MAGIC MEDICAL can comply with a legal obligation, in
particular legal requirements stemming from the Decree Law No. 663, which is the main legislation
establishing us as a legal entity.
The data needs to be processed for the legitimate interests of MAGIC MEDICAL or a third party
( provided the individual’s rights and freedoms are not overridden)
The individual has freely given clear consent
4.2 Purpose Limitation
We will only collect personal data for specified, explicit and legitimate reasons. We explain these reasons to
the individuals when we first collect their data as per the General Data Protection (or Privacy) Notice.
If we want to use personal data for reasons other than those given when we first obtained it, we will inform
the individuals concerned before we do so, and seek consent where necessary.
MAGIC MEDICAL staff will only process personal data where it is necessary in order to do their jobs. When
staff no longer need the personal data they hold, they will ensure it is deleted or anonymised or encrypted so as
to make it inaccessible . This will be done in accordance with MAGIC MEDICAL’s Data Retention Policy.
4.3 Data Minimization
All Personal data processed is adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes
for which they are processed. MAGIC MEDICAL may apply anonymization or pseudonymisation to
personal data if possible to reduce the risks to the data subjects concerned.
4.4 Accuracy
All Personal data processed is accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; reasonable steps are taken to
ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are
erased or rectified in a timely manner.
4.5 Storage Period Limitation
Personal data will be kept for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data is
processed (or will be anonymised or pseuonymised so that it cannot be used to identify the individual or
encrypted so as not to be accessible). This can be referenced in our Data Retention Policy.
4.6 Integrity and confidentiality
Taking into account the state of technology and other available security measures, the implementation cost,
and likelihood and severity of personal data risks , MAGIC MEDICALapplies appropriate technical
and organizational measures to process Personal Data in a manner that ensures appropriate security of personal
data, including protection against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized accessto, or
disclosure.
We will put measures in place to show that we have integrated data protection into all of our data processing
activities, including:
Only processing personal data that is necessary for each specific purpose of processing, and always in line
with the data protection principles set out in relevant data protection law
Completing privacy impact assessments where MAGIC MEDICAL processing of personal data presents
a high risk to rights and freedoms of individuals, and when introducing new technologies (the DPO will
advise on this process)

notices

data protection matters; we will also keep a record of attendance

their personal data (via our Data Protection notices)

disclosure, and against accidental or unlawful loss, destruction or damage. In particular:
Paper-based records that contain personal data are kept under lock and key when not in use

require not only passwords to be accessible but also secondary user confirmation (usually by requiring codes
despatched to mobile phones to be inserted in the device to secure connection)

notice/display boards, or left anywhere else where there is general access

security measuresto safeguard personal data that are appropriate to the associated risks. We will establish a
data sharing agreement with the supplier or contractor, to ensure the fair and lawful processing of any
personal data we share.
